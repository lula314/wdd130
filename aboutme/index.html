    <h2>Lucy Eldredge</h2>
    <p>Howdy, as stated above, my name is Lucy. I am from Meridian, Idaho in the Boise area. This is my fourth semester and I am a Software Engineering major.</p>
    <p>I just recently started learning to play the cello this year and it has been a fun adventure so far and I've been having a great time with it.</p>
    <p>I enjoy playing video games, especially with friends (Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Final Fantasy XIV).</p>
    <p>I also really enjoy reading, I like some of the classics particularly the sort of dystopians (Fahrenheit 451, 1984, The Giver) and right now I'm reading the Anne of Green Gables series and absolutely love it.</p>
    <p>Fun fact about me: I can recite 130 digits of pi from memory.</p>
